# Polygons

### Fundametals of Polygons
* Polygons are to planar geometry as integers are to numerical mathematics.
* Triangulations are the prime factorizations of polygons.  A decomposition of $P$ into triangles by a maximal set of noncrossing diagonals.  Here maximal means that no further diagonal may be added to the set without crossing one already in the set.
* Vertex or Vertices are the points
* Edge is the line segments
* Boundary is the set of vertices and edges of Polygon.
* Diagonal is a line segment connecting two vertices of $P$ and lying in the interior of $P$, not touching $\partial P$ except at its endpoints.
* Every polygon has a triangulation, however not true in 3D for a polyhedra.

### Polygon Jordan Curve Theorem

Boundary of $P$ is $\partial P$

The two components of $\mathbb{R}^2$ \ $\partial P$ are the bounded interior and the unbounded exterior. (The symbol \ indicates set subtraction: $A$ \ $B$ is the set of points in $A$ but not in $B$)

### Polyhedron
* Polyhedron is the 3D version of polygons.
* basic form of polyhedron is a tetrahedron.
